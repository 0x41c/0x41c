### Hey I am c0dine

I am a full stack developer with the knowledge of many various programming languages

Here is some of my stats while I make a proper readme LOL

I am currently working on a couple of plugins and tweaks that may or may not be open source.
Just look through my repos, leave a couple of stars and have a good day
